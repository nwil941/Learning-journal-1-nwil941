# Learning-journal-project1-nwil941

I found project one to be a nice way to meet my team members that I will be working with for the rest of the semester. 
It did not take that much time to get this project finished. We individually worked on looking at the different apps and then worked on the final sections at the end of the lab. 


# learning journal assignment 1 - problem solving

Unfortunatly the timeing of this sassignment made it very hard to be able to do the best of my ability.
I should have completed long before all my other assignments started creeping up.
Although i struggled i did enjoy doing it as it gave me time to practise.
